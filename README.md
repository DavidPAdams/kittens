# KITTENS API

A simple project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum for Ruby on Rails, [Project: APIs](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis?ref=lnav).

This is a small project where we set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API, yes about kittens.
